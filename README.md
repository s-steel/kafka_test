# Kafka Data Pipeline

## Objective:
Design and implement a Kafka consumer to consume data
from a Kafka topic and perform some basic processing on the data and identify some insights, if possible.

Configure another Kafka Topic and store the processed data in the new topic

Ensure that the pipeline can handle the streaming data continuously and efficiently,
handling any error messages or missing fields

## Design
Clearly explain your design choices, data flow, and how you ensure the pipeline's
efficiency, scalability, and fault tolerance in a Readme.

## Running Locally

## Additional Questions
1. How would you deploy this application in production?
2. What other components would you want to add to make this production ready?
3. How can this application scale with a growing dataset?
